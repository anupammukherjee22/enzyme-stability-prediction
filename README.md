## Enzyme Stability Prediction using Huber Regression

This project aims to predict the thermal stability (melting temperature, Tm) of protein enzymes using machine learning. The model is built using **Huber Regression**, a robust algorithm suited for noisy biochemical data. It uses sequence-derived features like amino acid composition, gravy score, aromaticity, charge, and sequence length. The model provides a faster and cost-effective alternative to traditional lab methods like Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), with applications in drug discovery, protein engineering, and molecular biology.
